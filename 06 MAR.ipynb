    "         Used Case : let say we have the hieght of student in class of college.\n",
    "                     then Descriptive statistics is used to find the mean hieght of class whereas Inferencial Statistics is used to conclude the mean hieght of the whole college with data we have.\n",

    "ANSWER : Concept Measurement of Data : In this concept, we have some condition based on the property of data to be analyse.So that we can find the best summary and insights from the data \n",

    "Example 1 : Suppose we have gender dataset so we cannot say the male is greater or lesser than female falls in nominal scale data category but if we have costumer feedback then we can say the  good > better > poor falls in ordinace scale data category.\n",
    "Example 2 : Suppose we have temperature dataset we can create the order of temperature and find the differnce which considered as good insight but we if we fing the ratio then it is not at all the useful insight falls and more importantly temperature can't be 0 in intervel scale data category\n",
    "temperature = {21,32,4,53,90,103 ... in f }\n",
    "whereas if we have the dataset based on the marks of student in class the we can create the order and find the differnces and ratio which is considered as the useful insight and marks can be 0.\n",
